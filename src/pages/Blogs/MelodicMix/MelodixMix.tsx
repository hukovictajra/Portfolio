					print to be featured on a tote bag and hoodie, showcasing all four artists in a unique and
					visually striking manner.

				<Paragraph>
					To bring this vision to life, I utilized Photoshop to merge elements from each artist's
					iconic imagery. I began by selecting high-quality images of Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift,
					Olivia Rodrigo, and The Weeknd. Then, I carefully cut out each artist from their
					respective images, ensuring precision and detail in the process.

			<BlogSection title="Applying Pop Art Style and Vibrant Colors 🖌️">
				<Paragraph>
					I applied a pop art style to each cutout, using vibrant colors of green, red, purple, and
					blue to create a dynamic and eye-catching effect. The pop art style lent a modern and
					energetic vibe to the design, perfectly reflecting the personalities and aesthetics of the
					artists.

					To further enhance the design, I incorporated iconic lyrics associated with each artist
