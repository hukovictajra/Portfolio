				<Paragraph>
					For this project, I created a dashboard aimed at enhancing the management and operational
					efficiency of a green company. The design inspiration came from various modern UI patterns
					and best practices observed in existing dashboards, which I tailored to fit the unique
					branding and user requirements of the green company.

				<Image
					source="@images/blogs/green-view-dashboard/gradient.png"
					className="rounded-lg md:rounded-md sm:rounded-sm xs:rounded-sm"
					modalClassName="!bg-white"
				/>

				<Text className="mb-4">The dashboard features two themes: light mode and dark mode.</Text>

				<List>
					<ListItem>
						Light Mode: The background is white, with a green gradient used as an accent color. Navy
						blue is used for text to provide a clear and pleasant contrast.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						Dark Mode: The background is navy blue, with a white and green gradient as the accent
						color. Text is displayed in white to maintain readability.
					</ListItem>
				</List>

				<Text className="mt-4">
					These color choices ensure that the dashboard is visually appealing, maintains brand
					consistency, and is accessible in both lighting conditions. I decided on the navy and
					green contrast to create a professional and calming aesthetic that aligns with the
					company's green and sustainable ethos. The navy blue provides a strong, stable background,
					while the green accents reinforce the environmental focus of the company.

			<BlogSection title="Typography">
				<Paragraph>
					For typography, I chose the Poppins font in different font weight variants. I find this
					font simple and easy to read, making it an ideal choice for a dashboard where users need
					to quickly digest information. By using Poppins, I aimed to ensure that the text is clear
					and legible, reducing eye strain for users who spend extended periods working with the
					dashboard.

			<BlogSection title="Design process">
				<Text>
					I started with a simple wireframe that captured the overall feel of the future design. I
					knew I wanted to include a navbar and a minimizable side menu, so it was important for me
					to decide on the overall possible placement of future widgets early on.
				</Text>

				<Image source="@images/blogs/green-view-dashboard/wireframe.png" />

				<Text>
					For widgets in the wireframing phase, I focused on ensuring they would be easy on the eyes
					and direct in presenting information. For widget content, I drew inspiration from various
					online examples, selecting elements that best fit the needs of the dashboard.
				</Text>
			</BlogSection>
			<BlogSection title="Design rationale">
				<Paragraph>
					The primary goal of the design was to create a dashboard that is not only functional but
					also user-friendly and visually appealing. By incorporating a responsive layout, the
					dashboard ensures that users can efficiently navigate through various sections and access
					the information they need quickly. The inclusion of dark and light modes caters to
					different user preferences and environmental conditions, enhancing overall usability.
				</Paragraph>

				<Paragraph>
					The side menu and navbar are strategically designed to maximize screen real estate while
					providing quick access to essential features and settings. The color scheme reinforces the
					green company's brand identity, promoting a sense of sustainability and environmental
					consciousness.
				</Paragraph>

				<Paragraph>
					The additional user information table provides a detailed view of customer data, allowing
					the company to manage and analyze customer interactions effectively.
