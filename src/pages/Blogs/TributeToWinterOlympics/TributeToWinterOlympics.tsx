				<Paragraph>
					I took a recent photo of Sarajevo and infused it with elements from a vintage postcard of
					the Sarajevo Olympics. It's a humble attempt to juxtapose the city's past and present in a
					nostalgic manner.

			<BlogSection title="Inspiration 🧠">
				<Paragraph>
					Sarajevo's rich history, especially its role as an Olympic host, inspired me to create
					this piece. I wanted to capture the essence of both eras and create a bridge between them.

			<BlogSection title="Process 🖌️">
				<Paragraph>
					I started with a photo I took of Sarajevo today. Then, I found a vintage postcard from the
					1984 Olympics and selected a few iconic elements, like the Olympic official logo. Using
					basic editing tools, I carefully placed these elements onto the modern photo, trying to
					maintain a sense of harmony between the two time periods.

					The result is a modest blend of past and present, evoking a sense of nostalgia for the
					Sarajevo of yesteryears. It's a small tribute to the city's history and its enduring
					spirit. I hope it resonates with those who have fond memories of the Olympics and those
					who cherish Sarajevo's journey over the years.
