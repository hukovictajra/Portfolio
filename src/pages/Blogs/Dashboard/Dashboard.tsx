			<BlogSection title="Initial Concept and Purpose">
				<Paragraph className="mb-4">
					The initial idea behind this dashboard was to provide users with complete freedom over its
					style, type, and functionality. Users can create an unlimited number of dashboards, which
					are accessible from the left-side menu. These dashboards can serve various purposes‚Äîfrom
					simple money-tracking systems to stock management or even company reporting.
				</Paragraph>

				<Paragraph>
					Widgets are placed and organized based on the user's preferences, ensuring that the
					dashboard adapts to their specific needs. While the future vision includes color
					customizability, the current version focuses on neutral, readable tones. This approach
					ensures clarity and establishes a hierarchy while presenting the dashboard's functionality
					effectively.
				</Paragraph>

			<BlogSection title="Wireframe to Final Version">
				<Paragraph>
					The project began with a wireframe to outline the layout and core features. This initial
					structure provided a foundation for refining usability and aesthetics. Key elements were
					placed as well as the widget layout.
