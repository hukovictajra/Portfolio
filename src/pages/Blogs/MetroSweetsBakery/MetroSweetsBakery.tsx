				<Paragraph>
					Moving into visual design, I selected color schemes, typography, and imagery to capture
					the essence of Metro Sweets. High-fidelity mockups were crafted to showcase the final look
					and feel. Responsive design was a key consideration, ensuring a seamless experience across
					devices. In the initial step, I immersed myself in brainstorming and ideation, generating
					a diverse range of concepts and features for the design. Prioritizing visual appeal, I
					conceptualized ideas aimed at enhancing the overall aesthetic while ensuring seamless
					functionality.

					Transitioning to the next phase, I carefully categorized elements and organized sections
					such as the menu, items, and checkout process. This structured approach facilitated
					consistency across different sections of the website, laying a strong foundation for the
					design process.As the project progressed, I focused on refining each individual frame,
					emphasizing clarity and coherence in the design. Carefully polishing every element, I

					I moved into the fourth step, fine-tuning and carefully checking every part of the design.
					Paying close attention to detail, I made sure not to miss anything, ensuring a thorough
					review of the entire project.\nThe design process peaked in the fifth step, where I turned
					ideas into practical designs using mockups and prototypes. By refining and iterating, I
					brought these concepts to life, creating effective design solutions.\nThis project marked
					a significant professional milestone and a personal journey of growth for me. It started
					as a small project, originating from a website I previously designed. Transitioning from
					desktop to mobile design presented a welcomed challenge, providing an opportunity to
					broaden my skill set and deepen my understanding of responsive design principles.

				<Paragraph>
					Recognizing the challenge of overbooking, we implemented a strategic solution. Through a
					dynamic ordering system, item availability became contingent on the limits set for a
					specific date and the total quantity ordered. This not only prevented overbooking but also
					ensured a smoother order management process for Metro Sweets.
